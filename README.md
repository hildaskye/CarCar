## Design

## Service microservice

Explain your models and integration with the inventory
microservice, here.
 Your README should contain instructions for how to run your application. This should
 include at minimum the commands to bring up your containers (ie. docker-compose up)
 and any other steps that need to be taken for proctors to grade your projects
 Fork the project from the repository, and run the following commands
    Run docker-compose up to bring up the containers using Docker. Navigate to localhost:3000 in the browser.


 Your README should also include the following:
 ○   A Simple Diagram of the Architecture

 ■   What’s running where?
 ■   Indicate what the bounded contexts and value objects are
 ○   Explicitly define the urls and ports for each of the microservices
 ○   A list of the CRUD routes for each of your resources
 ■   Think of this as the instructions for someone new to your project to gather
 an understanding of how to interact with your resources.
 ■   Provide specific URLS that can be added to insomnia once the
 application is running locally.
 ■   Provide sample POST data
 ■   Provide expected response data for each route.
 ■   all models are named and described  (this could be a use case, list of
 fields, some communication of why it exists)
 ○   Identify the value objects as well as:
 ■   Why they are needed.
 ■   How they are implemented because of why they’re needed.
 ●   What does all of this about the README mean?
 ○   Spend some time on your README
 ○   It’s not the notes for your project
 ■   Don’t leave git merge notes
 ■   Or what you did on a specific commit, that’s what git is for
 ■   Don’t leave instructions you followed in the README.
